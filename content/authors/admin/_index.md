I am a 4th year PhD Candidate in Biomedical Signal Processing at Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique (INRS), University of Quebec, Montreal.  I received my B. Tech. and M. Tech. from Indian Institute of Technology, Kharagpur in  Engineering Product Design and Manufacturing with specialization in Industrial Electronics in 2016. 

For my Master' thesis I worked on studying the effect of mental fatigue on EEG signals. I used functional connectivity analysis as well as other EEG spectral features to see the trend in the different EEG bands with increasing mental fatigue due to repetitive tasks. I also explored motif based features for Fatigue detection 

Currently, my field of research is focused around the use of biomedical signal processing for machine learning applications for predicting metrics like workload, fatigue etc. by making use of multiple modalities like respiration, heart rate, photoplethysmography etc. I explore the various signal properties (frequency transforms, non linearity etc.) in order to derive noise robust features. I am also exploring efficient lossless compression algorithms for ECG which can help lead to significant power savings for wearable devices where battery life is often a  big issue.
